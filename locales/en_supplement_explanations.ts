  explanation_protein_title: 'Protein Supplement',
  explanation_protein_why: 'Why was this recommended?',
  explanation_protein_why_content: 'Your estimated daily protein need is around {goal}g. Based on your diet, you needed about {needed}g more. Protein powder is an efficient way to meet this goal, aiding muscle repair and growth.',
  explanation_protein_type: 'Why this type?',
  explanation_protein_type_whey: 'Whey protein is a high-quality, fast-digesting protein, ideal for post-workout recovery.',
  explanation_protein_type_isolate: 'Whey Isolate was chosen because you mentioned lactose intolerance. It has most of the lactose filtered out, making it easier to digest.',
  explanation_protein_type_plant: 'A plant-based protein was chosen to align with your vegan preference. These blends combine multiple sources to provide a complete amino acid profile.',
  explanation_protein_dosing: 'Why {doses} dose(s)?',
  explanation_protein_dosing_content: 'We split your protein supplement intake into {doses} serving(s) of ~{dose_size}g each. This helps with better absorption and keeps your muscles supplied with amino acids throughout the day. A typical large scoop is 30-40g, so a {dose_size}g serving is {scoop_fraction} of a scoop.',
  explanation_protein_timing: 'Why these times?',
  explanation_protein_timing_post_workout: '• **Post-Workout:** Your muscles are most receptive to nutrients right after training. A protein shake here kickstarts the recovery process.',
  explanation_protein_timing_morning: '• **Morning/Breakfast:** Taking protein in the morning helps prevent muscle breakdown after an overnight fast.',
  explanation_protein_timing_lunch: '• **Lunch:** Spacing out protein intake improves absorption. Since you train in the morning, having protein at lunch keeps levels high after your post-workout window.',
  explanation_protein_timing_evening: '• **Evening/Before Bed:** A slow-digesting protein (or any protein) before bed can provide a steady release of amino acids overnight, aiding recovery while you sleep.',

  explanation_vitamind_title: 'Vitamin D3',
  explanation_vitamind_why: 'Why was this recommended?',
  explanation_vitamind_why_content: 'Vitamin D is essential for bone health, immune function, and hormone regulation, including testosterone. It was included based on your age and/or known deficiency to ensure you meet optimal levels.',

  explanation_magnesium_title: 'Magnesium',
  explanation_magnesium_why: 'Why was this recommended?',
  explanation_magnesium_why_content: 'Magnesium is involved in hundreds of bodily processes, including muscle function and energy production. For active individuals, it can help with muscle relaxation and improve sleep quality. The recommendation is based on your activity level.',

  explanation_betaalanine_title: 'Beta-Alanine',
  explanation_betaalanine_why: 'Why was this recommended?',
  explanation_betaalanine_why_content: 'This supplement helps buffer acid in muscles, increasing muscular endurance and allowing you to perform more reps. The tingling sensation (paresthesia) is a common and harmless side effect. We recommended splitting the dose if it\'s high to minimize this.',

  explanation_eaa_why_content: 'Essential Amino Acids (EAAs) or BCAAs are recommended because your training data indicates high workout density or fasted training. They provide a readily available fuel source for muscles, helping to prevent catabolism (muscle breakdown) during intense sessions.',

  explanation_zma_title: 'ZMA',
  explanation_zma_why: 'Why was this recommended?',
  explanation_zma_why_content: 'ZMA is a combination of Zinc Monomethionine Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, and Vitamin B6. It is recommended for you because of high training frequency which taxes the central nervous system. ZMA supports deep sleep and hormonal balance, accelerating recovery.',
