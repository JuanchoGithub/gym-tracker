  fatigue_info_content: "Your Central Nervous System (CNS) controls muscle recruitment. Unlike sore muscles, CNS fatigue is silent but systemic—affecting your whole body, mood, and sleep.\n\nThis metric tracks your cumulative load over the last 7 days based on exercise intensity (Compound lifts tax the CNS more than isolation). If your load exceeds your recovery capacity for too long, performance stalls and injury risk spikes.",
